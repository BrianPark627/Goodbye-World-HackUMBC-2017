# Goodbye-World-HackUMBC-2017
A suicide prevention text-based game for Hack UMBC Fall 2017.

### Working with Eclipse
Can be imported into Eclipse by downloading the repository and importing it as an archive folder. Run the GUI class.
If you can't run it as a Java Application, add the "src" folder to the build path.

### Working with IntellJ IDEA
Should be able to just import the project straight into IntelliJ with no problems.
